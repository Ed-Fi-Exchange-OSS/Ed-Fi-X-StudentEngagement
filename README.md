# Ed-Fi-X Student Engagement Tracking and Reports

Remote Learning Student Engagement Tracking and Reports. These reports cover some of the basic measures to track student engagement during COVID19  and Remote Learning.

## Overview

This distribution contains a set of tools that enable the tracking of Student's Learning events. Once we have learning events in a data store we create reports to ensure that student engagement is active and consistent.

These scripts are provided as-is, but the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the Ed-Fi Alliance welcomes feedback on additions or changes that would make these resources more user friendly. Feedback is best shared by raising a ticket on the Ed-Fi Tracker [Exchange Contributions Project](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/projects/EXC).

## Limitations

This repository includes a google chrome plugin that captures student navigation. The known limitation is that the students will have to use Google Chrome browser.

## Contributing

Looking for an easy way to get started? Search for tickets with label
"up-for-grabs" in Tracker **[Link that text to a pre-existing query for the
project]**; these are nice-to-have but low priority tickets that should not
require in-depth knowledge of the code base and architecture.
